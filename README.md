## 👨‍💻 Developer Notes

Smeltra is written in **Rust**, using low-level memory reading/writing techniques to remain external. It does **not inject** any DLLs and interacts with `cs2.exe` and `client.dll` externally.

More features are planned. Feedback and suggestions welcome via the community links above.
